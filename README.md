# rollies & svelte-trois

This repo has two different things in it:

1. Rollies, a 3D dice roller that I'm making using `svelte-cubed`
2. `svelte-trois`, a library that I'm building to fill gaps in the `svelte-cubed`
   API, seeing as it's so new.

If you're here, you probably just want the [`svelte-trois` docs](src/lib/svelte-trois).

## TODO

- Pre-commit with husky
